From time to time I work on my blog. I don't plan to scale it much, I've
pretty clear idea how it should look like. I would say it's 40 % done.

### Todo
- Retrieve old input values if updating/creating new article fails
- Backend graphics
- Comment section
- Google analytics
- Clear redundant code in HomeController
- Comment controllers
- Remove bug with duplicating titles on edit
- Add tests
- Sort tag articles
